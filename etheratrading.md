## 🎯 Strategic Pivot — 2026-05-11

After 10 days of building 5 selective signals (A1, A2, B2, A3, B5) and running 2 real-data backtests against SPY across 4 years (2022–2026), **none of the signals showed positive alpha vs the benchmark**. This is consistent with academic literature: most published anomalies have decayed 60-80% post-publication, and single-factor long-only strategies typically lose to passive in bull markets.

### Decision: Reframe from "Alpha Generator" to "Disciplined Exposure Manager"

**Old framing**: AI picks individual stocks to outperform SPY.
**New framing**: AI holds SPY by default, **tilts allocation 50-150%** based on composite factor model, removes emotional/timing friction.

**Why this works**:
- Behavioral finance research: retail investors lose 2-4% CAGR through bad timing decisions; automating that captures real value
- Multi-factor blends consistently beat single-factor in academic literature (modest alpha, ~1-2% per year)
- The LLM + agent infrastructure's real strength is decision support + automation, not alpha discovery
- We're not competing with Renaissance/AQR (hundreds of factors, billions of capital) — we're solving a real retail problem

### v1 + v2 Backtest Findings (Source of Truth)

| Signal | v1 Sharpe | v2 Sharpe | v2 Alpha | Verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| SPY (4yr benchmark) | 1.14 | 1.02 | — | — |
| A1 Sector RS | 0.83 | 0.67 | -12.0% | Underperforms; mean-reverts on defensives |
| A2 PEAD | 0.18 | 0.43 | -17.1% | Working as designed; data sparse |
| B2 Analyst Rev (3mo) | **1.51** | 0.75 | -16.4% | v1 config was right; v2 relaxation degraded |
| A3 Insider | -0.05 | 0.00 | -17.3% | Broken; dynamic CIK lookup needs debug |
| B5 Short Squeeze | 0.00 | **-0.90** | **-29.6%** | Catastrophic falling-knife trap |

### New Product Vision (under revision — see ⚠️ below)

> *"I hold SPY by default. When my factor model says risk-on, I tilt to 120%. When risk-off, 70%. The AI handles timing, sizing, rebalancing, and reporting so I don't have to think about it daily."*

### ⚠️ Status update — 2026-05-12 (Batch 21)

The breadth-based SPY-tilt implementation of this vision **passed in-sample (2022-2026: Sharpe 1.14 vs SPY 0.99) but failed out-of-sample (2015-2019: Sharpe 0.51 vs SPY 0.73, CAPM α −1.75%)** — the timing edge did not generalize. What *did* survive both windows: **A1 sector relative strength as a low-beta defensive equity sleeve** (~+1.7% CAPM alpha, β ≈ 0.5, ~⅔ SPY drawdown). A2/B2 are non-viable on free Finnhub data.

So the *deliverable, honest* product is currently "**a low-beta equity sleeve**" rather than "a smart SPY-timing overlay". A regime-gated tilt (using the macro regime detector instead of stock breadth) is the next thing to test before concluding timing has no edge here. The exposure-manager infrastructure (tilt engine, ExposureSnapshot) is built and reusable. **Directional decision pending.**

| Feature | Files | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Approval API Routes | `app/api/proposals/[id]/{approve,reject,defer}/route.ts` | ✅ | Mirrors Python `DbDecisionStore.record_decision` exactly; 409 if already decided, 404 if not found |

### Batch 6: A1 Sector Relative-Strength Signal [Merged PR #50]
**PR #50 (CI: ✅ passed 2026-05-11, format fix in commit 129f177)**

| Feature | Files | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Signal implementation | `src/ai_agent/signals/sector_rs.py` | ✅ | `SectorRelativeStrengthSignal` — long when stock 20d return exceeds sector ETF by ≥2% |
| `__init__.py` export | `src/ai_agent/signals/__init__.py` | ✅ | `SectorRelativeStrengthSignal` added to public API |
| CLI registration | `scripts/backtest_signal.py` | ✅ | `sector_relative_strength` choice + `--sector-map` JSON flag |
| Test suite | `tests/signals/test_sector_rs.py` | ✅ | 16 tests (outperform→long, underperform→flat, threshold edge, SPY fallback, insufficient history) |

**First real signal flowing through C1 harness.** Validated 2026-05-11 (synthetic data, harness verified).

---

### Batch 7: C1 Harness Fix + A1 Backtest Validation [Merged PR #51]
**PR #51 (CI: ✅ passed 2026-05-11)**

| Feature | Files | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Harness bug fix | `src/ai_agent/signals/runner.py` | ✅ | `_inject_sector_prices()` — ETF bars now wired into signal before per-symbol loop; was producing 0 trades |
| Backtest report | `reports/a1-backtest.md` | ✅ | 18 symbols × 521 days; synthetic data (sandbox network blocked); Sharpe 0.46, harness verified |
| Backtest script | `scripts/run_a1_backtest.py` | ✅ | Reproducible real-data script (runs when network available) |

**Critical fix**: without this, every signal relying on external prices would silently produce 0 trades in production.

### Batch 21: Out-of-Sample Test (2015-2019) — SPY Tilt Does NOT Generalize [2026-05-12]
**Workflow run with `BACKTEST_START=2015-01-01 BACKTEST_END=2019-12-31`**

| Strategy | Sharpe | CAGR | MaxDD | CAPM α | β | Trades |
|----------|--------|------|-------|--------|---|--------|
| **SPY (benchmark)** | **0.73** | 9.4% | -20.2% | — | 1.0 | — |
| A1 Sector RS (10 sym) | 0.74 | 6.4% | -13.4% | **+1.7%** | 0.49 | 498 |
| A2 PEAD | — | — | — | — | — | 0 (no pre-2020 Finnhub earnings) |
| B2 Analyst Rev | — | — | — | — | — | 0 (Finnhub rec history too shallow) |
| Composite | 0.74 | 6.4% | -13.4% | +1.7% | 0.49 | 498 (= A1) |
| **SPY Tilt 50-100%** | **0.51** | 4.0% | -14.2% | **−1.75%** | 0.60 | 319 |

**Verdict: the v4 "SPY Tilt beats SPY" result was period-specific.** In 2022-2026 the tilt had Sharpe 1.14 vs SPY 0.99 (+0.15) and positive timing alpha. In 2015-2019 it has Sharpe 0.51 vs SPY 0.73 (**−0.22**) and CAPM α **−1.75%** — worse than a constant ~61% SPY position (≈5.7% CAGR / 0.73 Sharpe). The breadth-based timing de-risked at the wrong moments. **Not a robust edge.**

**What DID hold up: A1 itself.** +1.7% CAPM alpha, β ≈ 0.5, Sharpe matching SPY, ~⅔ the drawdown — consistent across both windows. A1 is a real (modest) *low-beta defensive equity sleeve*, not an alpha generator or a smart SPY-timing overlay.

**A2/B2 are non-viable on free Finnhub** for any historical work — no pre-2020 earnings actuals, shallow rec history. The composite is effectively just A1.

**Decision: PAUSE Phase B.3 product UI** — don't build a tilt dashboard around a timing overlay that subtracts value out-of-sample. The `ExposureSnapshot`/tilt-engine plumbing is retained (can drive whatever allocation logic we settle on). Reframe options under consideration:
- **(a) Low-beta equity sleeve** — hold the A1-leading basket; ~half SPY's vol, +1-2% structural alpha, smaller drawdowns. Deliverable today, honest.
- **(b) Regime-gated exposure** — replace the breadth-tilt input with the macro regime detector (VIX + SPY trend). De-risk on regime, not on stock breadth. Needs its own backtest. *(Lead's recommendation for next cycle.)*
- **(c) Accept "constant ~65% equity"** — what a target-date fund does for free.

### Batch 20: Phase B.3 — Exposure Tilt Engine + Daily Digest Wiring [Merged PR #63]
**PR #63 (CI: ✅ merged 2026-05-12) — infra retained even though the breadth-tilt itself is paused (Batch 21)**

| Component | Files | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| `ai_agent.exposure` package | `src/ai_agent/exposure/{tilt,job}.py` | ✅ | `score_to_allocation()` (shared formula — `SpyTiltStrategy` delegates to it), `TiltSnapshot` + `compute_tilt_snapshot()` (current allocation from latest bars), `tilt_summary_line()` (Telegram one-liner), `build_composite_signal()` / `make_snapshot()` (live A1+A2+B2 composite over the 11-symbol universe), `persist_snapshot()` / `latest_snapshot()` |
| `ExposureSnapshot` DB model | `src/ai_agent/db/models.py` | ✅ | Daily target SPY allocation + composite score + per-symbol breakdown; upsert by `as_of` |
| `SECTOR_MAP` single source of truth | `exposure/job.py` ← `run_all_backtests.py` imports it | ✅ | Backtest and live tilt can't disagree about the universe |
| Daily digest section | `src/ai_agent/digest/daily_digest.py` | ✅ | "📈 Exposure tilt: 65% SPY (composite +0.09, 11 names)" — reads latest snapshot, gracefully omitted if none |
| `scripts/tilt_snapshot.py` CLI | + `python -m ai_agent.exposure.job` | ✅ | Fetches latest bars (yfinance), builds sector_prices, persists an `ExposureSnapshot`; `--dry-run` to log only. Cron-able like `macro_regime.py` |
| Tests | `tests/exposure/test_{tilt,job}.py`, digest tests | ✅ | 614 total passing |

**Still pending in Phase B.3**: `app/tilt/page.tsx` dashboard + `app/api/tilt/route.ts` (need browser/visual QA), drawdown protection (auto-reduce to 50% on VIX > 30 / bear regime), Kelly-style sizing.

### Batch 19: v4 Results — Phase B Exposure Manager Validated [2026-05-12]
**Workflow run on main after PRs #59/#60/#61**

| Strategy | Sharpe | CAGR | MaxDD | Trades | Verdict |
|----------|--------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| **SPY (benchmark)** | 0.99 | 16.6% | -19.0% | — | — |
| A1 Sector RS (11 sym) | 0.90 | 9.8% | -12.6% | 517 | Real signal, sub-SPY return |
| A2 PEAD | 0.22 | 0.2% | -0.8% | 7 | Data-limited (free Finnhub lacks deep earnings history) |
| B2 Analyst Rev | 1.10 | 1.3% | -0.7% | 11 | High-quality, very low-frequency |
| Composite | 0.93 | 10.3% | -12.6% | 528 | ≈ A1 (A2/B2 barely contribute) |
| **SPY Tilt 50-100%** | **1.14** | 11.8% | **-11.2%** | 279 | **Beats SPY on Sharpe + halves drawdown** |

**Verdict: the exposure-manager thesis holds.** SPY Tilt has a 15% higher Sharpe than buy-and-hold SPY and 41% smaller max drawdown. Critically, a naive constant-65% SPY position would have ~0.99 Sharpe (scaling exposure doesn't change Sharpe) — the tilt's 1.14 is genuine timing skill (de-risk before drawdowns, re-risk before rallies) worth ~0.15 Sharpe + ~1% CAGR over the constant version. This is the "modest factor premium + behavioral discipline" the strategic pivot promised.

`score_distribution`: min 0.0 (→50% SPY), median 0.091 (→~65% SPY), max 0.455 (→100% SPY). Tilt now genuinely swings the full band (279 trades vs 49 in the broken near-constant version).

**Open caveats**: (1) mild survivorship bias — 11-symbol universe chosen after seeing v3 losers; (2) one 4yr mostly-bull window — needs out-of-sample (2015-2019) validation; (3) composite is really "A1 breadth → SPY tilt", not a 3-factor blend; (4) reported `alpha` (CAGR diff) is unfair to low-beta strategies — added `capm_alpha`/`beta` in Batch 18.

**Decision: green-light Phase B.3** (tilt dashboard + Telegram digest). Next analytical priority: out-of-sample backtest via the new `BACKTEST_START`/`BACKTEST_END` env override.

### Batch 18: Backtest Period Override + CAPM Alpha [2026-05-12]
**PR #62 (in progress)**

| Change | Rationale | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **`BACKTEST_START`/`BACKTEST_END`/`BACKTEST_LOOKBACK_DAYS` env override** in `run_all_backtests.py` | Enables out-of-sample runs (e.g. 2015-2019) without code changes — the #1 validation gap | ✅ |
| **`capm_alpha_beta()` in `metrics.py`** | Jensen's alpha + beta from OLS regression of daily excess returns; fair to low-beta exposure-manager strategies (the naive CAGR-diff `alpha` structurally penalizes them). Exposed in `summary()` and the backtest JSON. | ✅ |
| **8 new tests** | beta=1 self-regression, beta=0.5 half-exposure, zero-variance benchmark, insufficient overlap, positive-alpha case | ✅ (582 total) |

---

### Batch 17: SPY Tilt Score Normalization [Merged PR #60]
**PR #60 (CI: ✅ merged 2026-05-12)**

| Change | Rationale | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Add `score_floor`/`score_ceiling` to `SpyTiltStrategy`** | Composite per-symbol score = (A1+A2+B2)/3; A2/B2 abstain ~98% of bars, so universe-average peaks near ~0.30. Without rescaling the tilt is stuck at ~55% SPY — useless as an exposure manager. `score_ceiling=0.30` maps the realistic range to the full 50-100% band. | ✅ |
| **Emit score distribution in backtest JSON** | `spy_tilt.score_distribution` (min/median/max) so we can tune `score_ceiling` empirically from real runs | ✅ |
| **6 new tests** | normalization no-op default, ceiling compression, clamping above/below, floor offset | ✅ (576 total) |

---

### Batch 16: v4 Tuning — A2 Fix + Universe Narrowing [2026-05-12]
**PR #59 (in progress)**

| Change | Rationale | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Paginate Finnhub earnings fetch** in 90-day chunks | Root cause of A2's 9 trades: free tier caps `/calendar/earnings` at 3-month range. Single 1460-day call silently truncated. Now 16 chunks × 11 symbols = ~176 API calls. | ✅ |
| **Narrow A1 universe to 11 symbols** | Removed JNJ (-0.47), PEP (-0.53), PFE (-0.60), PG (-0.40), UNH (-0.11), KO (marginal +0.24). Retained: AAPL MSFT GOOGL (XLK), JPM BAC GS (XLF), XOM CVX (XLE), AMZN HD TSLA (XLY). | ✅ |
| **Update etheratrading.md** with v3 findings + v4 decisions | Documentation sync | ✅ |

### Batch 15: Phase B — SpyTiltStrategy (Exposure Manager) [Merged PR #58]
**PR #58 (CI: ✅ merged 2026-05-12)**

| Feature | Files | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| `SpyTiltStrategy` | `src/ai_agent/backtest/spy_tilt.py` | ✅ | Pre-computes avg composite score across universe per date; maps score → SPY allocation fraction `[min_alloc, max_alloc]`; rebalances only when gap ≥ 5% |
| `FractionalSignalStrategy` | `src/ai_agent/signals/strategy_adapter.py` | ✅ | Per-stock variant: deploys `score × cash` (0.33 → 33%, 0.67 → 67%, 1.0 → 100%) instead of all-in binary |
| SPY tilt backtest run | `scripts/run_all_backtests.py` | ✅ | `SPY_tilt_50_100` run added (50-100% SPY allocation band) |
| Tests | `tests/backtest/test_spy_tilt.py`, `tests/signals/test_strategy_adapter.py` | ✅ | 30 new tests; total 570 passing |

---

### Batch 14: Phase A — CompositeFactorSignal + Strategic Pivot [Merged PR #57]
**PR #57 (CI: ✅ merged 2026-05-12)**

| Feature | Files | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| `CompositeFactorSignal` | `src/ai_agent/signals/composite.py` | ✅ | Weighted-average blender; continuous score [0,1]; custom weights + name suffix; 23 tests |
| Kill A3/B5 | `signals/__init__.py`, `scripts/backtest_signal.py` | ✅ | Removed from public API + CLI registry; source files archived |
| v3 backtest rewrite | `scripts/run_all_backtests.py` | ✅ | B2 reverted to 3-month streak; A1/A2 kept at v2 thresholds; composite run added |

### Batch 13: v3 Backtest Results (Real Data, 2022-2026) [2026-05-12]
**Workflow run on main after PR #57 merge**

| Signal | Sharpe | CAGR | MaxDD | Alpha | Trades | Verdict |
|--------|--------|------|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| **SPY (benchmark)** | **0.99** | **16.6%** | **-19.0%** | — | — | — |
| A1 Sector RS | 0.68 | 5.4% | -9.4% | -11.2% | 720 | Real signal; defensives drag it down |
| A2 PEAD | 0.43 | 0.2% | -0.4% | -16.4% | **9** | **Data starvation (fixed in v4)** |
| B2 Analyst Rev | 1.16 | 0.9% | -0.5% | -15.7% | **12** | Best per-trade quality; too sparse |
| Composite equal | 0.71 | 5.7% | -9.4% | -10.9% | 732 | Dominated by A1 (A2/B2 near-zero) |
| **SPY Tilt 50-100%** | *pending v4* | | | | | First run pending |

**Key insights from v3**:
1. A2 fired only 9 times in 4 years across 17 symbols — confirmed Finnhub API truncation bug (3-month limit)
2. B2's 1.16 Sharpe on 12 trades is *directionally* valid — GOOGL, AAPL, TSLA all worked when it fired
3. A1's composite includes JNJ/PEP/PFE/PG which reliably lose; removing them is the highest-ROI fix
4. Composite ≈ A1/3 because A2/B2 inject zeros on ~98% of bars → not truly a multi-factor blend yet

### Batch 13 (old): v2 Backtest Validation + Strategic Pivot Decision [2026-05-11]
**Two real-data backtest runs against SPY 2022-2026**

| Run | Window | Universe | Key Finding |
|-----|--------|----------|-------------|
| **v1** | 2024-2026 (2yr bull) | 17 large-caps | SPY 1.14 Sharpe; 0/5 signals beat. A1 overtrading (1,112 trades). B2 highest at 1.51 Sharpe but sparse. A3 only UNH fired. B5 zero trades. |
| **v2** | 2022-2026 (4yr) | 17 LC + 8 mid-cap (A3) + 6 high-short (B5) | SPY 1.02 Sharpe. A1 trades dropped to 722 (good). B2 degraded to 0.75 with relaxation (v1 was better). A3 zero data (dynamic CIK broken). B5 catastrophic (-0.90 Sharpe, -99% MaxDD on BYND). |

**Verdict**: 0/5 signals have positive alpha. Selective signal approach won't beat SPY at retail scale.

**Strategic decision (user-confirmed 2026-05-11)**: Pivot from alpha discovery to **disciplined exposure manager**. Combine surviving signals (A1, A2, B2) into composite factor blend driving SPY allocation tilt 50-150%. See top-of-doc strategic pivot section.

### Batch 12: Unified Real-Data Backtest Infrastructure [Merged PR #56]
**PR #56 (CI: ✅ passed 2026-05-11)**

| Feature | Files | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Unified backtest script | `scripts/run_all_backtests.py` | ✅ | Pulls 2y of yfinance OHLCV + short interest, Finnhub earnings + recs, SEC EDGAR Form 4; runs A1/A2/B2/A3/B5 against same 17-symbol universe + SPY benchmark; writes `backtest_results.json` |
| GitHub Actions workflow | `.github/workflows/signal-backtests.yml` | ✅ | `workflow_dispatch` + monthly cron; uploads `backtest_results.json` artifact (90-day retention); prints summary table per run |
| Shared data fetch | (inside script) | ✅ | One yfinance call covers prices + sector ETFs + benchmark; one Finnhub pass covers earnings + recs; one SEC pass covers all CIKs — eliminates redundant network for cross-signal validation |

**Validates the 5 shipped signals end-to-end on real market data.** Needs `FINNHUB_API_KEY` secret. First run produces portfolio Sharpe/CAGR/alpha-vs-SPY + per-symbol breakdowns for every signal in a single JSON artifact.

**PR #55 (CI: ✅ passed 2026-05-11)**

| Feature | Files | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Signal implementation | `src/ai_agent/signals/short_interest.py` | ✅ | `ShortInterestMomentumSignal` — long when `short_percent_of_float >= 15%` AND 20d return `>= 3%`; avoids falling-knife trap |
| yfinance injection helper | `src/ai_agent/signals/runner.py` | ✅ | `_inject_short_interest()` + call in `backtest_signal()`; yfinance `shortPercentOfFloat`; try/except → default 0.0 offline |
| `__init__.py` export | `src/ai_agent/signals/__init__.py` | ✅ | `ShortInterestMomentumSignal` added to public API |
| CLI registration | `scripts/backtest_signal.py` | ✅ | `short_interest_momentum` choice in `REGISTRY` |
| Test suite | `tests/signals/test_short_interest.py` | ✅ | 19 tests across 8 classes (squeeze setup, low short, negative momentum, flat momentum, exact thresholds, custom params, insufficient history, missing data, attributes) |

**Fifth real signal through C1.** Squeeze-setup logic: short interest as squeeze fuel + price momentum as trigger. Data source: yfinance `shortPercentOfFloat` — no FINRA REGSHO parser needed; NYSE/NASDAQ publish snapshot ~twice monthly.

### Batch 10: A3 Insider Buying (Form 4) Signal [Merged PR #54]
**PR #54 (CI: ✅ passed 2026-05-11)**

| Feature | Files | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Signal implementation | `src/ai_agent/signals/insider_buying.py` | ✅ | `InsiderBuyingSignal` + `InsiderBuy` dataclass; long when ≥2 distinct officers/directors buy ≥$50k combined within 90d; filters code==P, direct==D, officer OR director |
| SEC EDGAR client | `src/ai_agent/data/sec_edgar_source.py` | ✅ | `SecEdgarSource` — no API key; User-Agent with email required (SEC policy); fetches submissions JSON + parses Form 4 XML `nonDerivativeTransaction` rows |
| EDGAR injection helper | `src/ai_agent/signals/runner.py` | ✅ | `_inject_insider_events()` + `SYMBOL_TO_CIK` Phase-1 dict (30 large-caps); wired into `backtest_signal()` alongside A1/A2/B2 injectors |
| `__init__.py` export | `src/ai_agent/signals/__init__.py` | ✅ | `InsiderBuy`, `InsiderBuyingSignal` added to public API |
| CLI registration | `scripts/backtest_signal.py` | ✅ | `insider_buying` choice in `REGISTRY` |
| Test suite | `tests/signals/test_insider_buying.py` | ✅ | 31 tests across 8 classes (sufficient buying, single insider, low value, stale events, non-buy codes, indirect ownership, 10%-owner exclusion, custom thresholds, empty data, attributes) |

**Fourth real signal through C1.** Based on Cohen, Malloy & Pomorski (2012) insider buying anomaly. SEC EDGAR free API integrated via `_inject_insider_events()`. Phase-1 CIK map hardcoded for 30 large-caps; dynamic lookup is Phase-2 follow-up.

### Batch 8: A2 Post-Earnings Drift (PEAD) Signal [Merged PR #52]
**PR #52 (CI: ✅ passed 2026-05-11)**

| Feature | Files | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Signal implementation | `src/ai_agent/signals/pead.py` | ✅ | `PostEarningsDriftSignal` + `EarningsEvent` dataclass; long when earnings surprise ≥ threshold within lookback/holding windows |
| Finnhub injection helper | `src/ai_agent/signals/runner.py` | ✅ | `_inject_earnings_events()` — fetches `/calendar/earnings` via existing `FinnhubSource`, mirrors `_inject_sector_prices()` pattern |
| `__init__.py` export | `src/ai_agent/signals/__init__.py` | ✅ | `EarningsEvent`, `PostEarningsDriftSignal` added to public API |
| CLI registration | `scripts/backtest_signal.py` | ✅ | `post_earnings_drift` choice in `REGISTRY` |
| Test suite | `tests/signals/test_pead.py` | ✅ | 20 tests across 8 classes (surprise thresholds, windows, zero-consensus guard, multi-event, empty list) |

**Second real signal through C1.** Based on Bernard & Thomas (1989/1990) PEAD anomaly. FinnhubSource wrapper reused (no new deps).

## 🚀 Roadmap — v4 Tuning + Exposure Manager Product

### Phase A: Composite Factor Blend [✅ SHIPPED — PR #57]
| Task | Priority | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Kill A3 + B5 — remove from registry | P0 | ✅ Done |
| Revert B2 to `min_consecutive_months=3` | P0 | ✅ Done |
| Build `CompositeFactorSignal` | P0 | ✅ Done |
| Backtest composite vs SPY | P0 | ✅ Done (v3 results: 0.71 Sharpe, -10.9% alpha) |

### Phase B: Exposure Manager Core [✅ SHIPPED — PR #58]
| Task | Priority | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `FractionalSignalStrategy` — score-proportional position sizing | P0 | ✅ Done |
| `SpyTiltStrategy` — SPY allocation 50-100% (backtest) / 50-150% (live w/ margin) | P0 | ✅ Done |
| SPY tilt backtest run in v3 script | P0 | ✅ Done (first results pending v4 run) |

### Phase B.2: Data Quality Fixes [✅ DONE — PRs #59/#60/#61]
| Task | Priority | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Fix A2 data starvation: paginate earnings fetch in 90-day chunks | P0 | ✅ Done (#59) — but free Finnhub still lacks deep history; A2 effectively data-limited |
| Narrow A1 universe: remove defensive/pharma (6 symbols) | P0 | ✅ Done (#59) — Sharpe 0.68 → 0.90 |
| Fix SPY tilt near-constant allocation (score normalization) | P0 | ✅ Done (#60) — tilt now swings 50-100% |
| Throttle Finnhub to free-tier rate limit | P0 | ✅ Done (#60) — A2/B2 data restored |
| Reconciliation: skip gracefully when T212 unconfigured | P1 | ✅ Done (#61) |
| v4 in-sample backtest (2022-2026) | P0 | ✅ Done — SPY Tilt Sharpe 1.14 vs SPY 0.99 (later shown period-specific — see Batch 21) |
| Out-of-sample backtest (2015-2019) | P0 | ✅ Done (#62 env override) — **SPY Tilt does NOT generalize** (Sharpe 0.51 vs SPY 0.73, CAPM α −1.75%). A1 alone holds up (+1.7% CAPM α). See Batch 21. |

### Phase B.3: Exposure Manager Product UI [⏸ PAUSED — see Batch 21]
The breadth-based SPY tilt failed out-of-sample, so the dashboard/digest product is on hold pending a directional decision (low-beta sleeve vs regime-gated tilt vs accept constant exposure). Tilt-engine + ExposureSnapshot plumbing is shipped (#62/#63) and reusable for whatever we pick.
| Task | Priority | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Tilt-engine + ExposureSnapshot + digest wiring | P0 | ✅ Shipped (#62/#63) — kept regardless of direction |
| `app/tilt/page.tsx` dashboard + API route | P1 | ⏸ Paused — don't build UI around a non-robust strategy |
| Directional decision: (a) low-beta sleeve / (b) regime-gated tilt / (c) constant exposure | P0 | Pending user call |
| Regime-gated exposure backtest (if (b)) | P1 | Pending |

### Phase C: Discipline + Automation Features [Week 3+]
- Tax-loss harvesting suggestions
- Automatic rebalancing alerts
- Cost-basis tracking integration
- Behavioral coaching (delayed trades, cooldown periods)

### Killed/Deprioritized
- **A3 (Insider Buying)**: Dynamic CIK lookup broken; even when fixed, mid-cap insider data sparse. Archive code, revisit if paid Form 4 feed (InsiderInsights, OpenInsider) becomes affordable.
- **B5 (Short Squeeze)**: Catastrophic falling-knife trap (-0.9 Sharpe, -99% MaxDD on BYND). Signal logic fundamentally flawed without a proper trend filter. Archive.
- **B1 (Options Flow)**: Paid feed required; deprioritized until exposure manager ships.
- **T212 / MarketWatch / Twitter / StockTwits / Dark Pool**: All rejected (low SNR or paid).

---

### Phase B: Native iOS [Decision Gate]
**Blocker**: Requires 2-week PWA adoption data (install rate, daily active users, retention).

**Scope if approved**:
- Xcode project targeting iOS 15.4+
- ORCA (in-app trading interface) parity with PWA
- Push notifications via APN (not web-push)
- Home screen persistence, biometric auth

**Decision**: Check adoption metrics end of May 2026; greenlight only if DAU >50% of installs.

---

### Phase C: Broker Integration (Out of Scope, Q3+ 2026)
- Order submission to Alpaca / Interactive Brokers
- Account state sync (positions, buying power)
- Trade confirmation flow
- Requires full compliance / audit trail

## 🛠️ Technical Notes & Glossary

### Tiered LLM Routing
- **Haiku** (cheap, fast): Screening, classification, simple decisions
- **Opus** (expensive, powerful): Deep analysis, synthesis, design
- **Sonnet** (balanced): Implementation, testing, distribution
- **Cost reduction**: 65–75% vs. uniform Opus usage (screened 80% of proposals by Haiku, only complex ones to Opus)

### Prompt Caching
- Server-side cache of repeated system prompts / context
- Reduces token usage for multi-turn proposal analysis
- Integrated into daily digest flow

### Signal Validation (C1)
- **Backtest**: Multi-year, daily bar data, sharpe >0.5 gate
- **Shadow**: 2 weeks live production data, NO money deployed, only tracking
- **Live**: After shadow passes, real capital deployed

### Web Push vs. Telegram
- **Telegram**: Synchronous, user-initiated check-in (click message link)
- **Web Push**: Asynchronous, browser-initiated notification (arrives proactively)
- **Both run in parallel**: User can approve from either channel

### Responsive Design Breakpoints
- `<sm` (mobile, <640px): Card list, hamburger nav, sticky-bottom actions
- `>=sm` (tablet/desktop, ≥640px): Table grid, top nav, inline buttons

### PWA Capabilities
- **Installable**: Desktop, iOS, Android
- **Offline**: Cache-first shell (pages), network-first API (real-time)
- **Notifications**: Web Push API (push event → notificationclick handler)
- **Icons**: Auto-generated at build time from `branding/sigil.svg` (one-file update)

### Daily Operations Schedule
- **Daily agent loop**: `06:30 UTC, Mon–Fri` (US pre-market) — `.github/workflows/daily.yml`
  - Entry: `python -m ai_agent.loop.daily_loop`
  - Steps: init DB → load watchlist → halt check → ingest bars → build T212 client → run Claude agent → risk-rail filter → persist proposals → send Telegram digest
  - Manual trigger: GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch` with optional `--dry-run`
  - Local trigger: `python -m ai_agent.loop.daily_loop --dry-run`
- **Daily digest (cost + proposals)**: shares the same cron; pushes to Telegram + web-push
- **Macro regime snapshot**: `.github/workflows/macro-regime.yml` (separate cron, refreshes regime classifier daily)
- **Shadow MTM**: `.github/workflows/shadow-mtm.yml` (marks-to-market shadow positions for validation accuracy)

### Signal Source Research (Lead Architect Notes — 2026-05-11)

**Constraint**: The agent ingests only **programmatic, machine-readable** signal sources. Video/audio channels (e.g., JdubTrades_Telegram) cannot be parsed natively — would need transcription pipeline or manual screenshot OCR.

**Tier 1 — On Roadmap (free or already provisioned)**
| Signal | Source | Edge basis |
|--------|--------|------------|
| A2: Post-earnings drift (PEAD) | Finnhub (provisioned) | Earnings surprise × trend persistence — academic anomaly (Bernard & Thomas) |
| A3: Insider Form 4 | SEC EDGAR (free) | Officer/director buys precede outsized returns (Cohen, Malloy, Pomorski) |
| B2: Analyst estimate revisions | Finnhub `/stock/recommendation` (free) | 3+ consecutive upward EPS revisions → 3–12mo outperformance (Hawkins et al.) |
| B5: Short interest + momentum | yfinance `shortPercentOfFloat` (free) | High short float + positive 20d momentum = squeeze setup |
| B1: Options flow | Polygon/Tradier (paid, opt-in) | Unusual call/put volume detects institutional positioning before price moves |

**Tier 2 — Considered, deprioritized**
| Source | Reason to skip |
|--------|----------------|
| Twitter/X sentiment | API gated behind $100+/mo paywall, coverage degraded |
| StockTwits | Free but high retail noise, low signal-to-noise |
| Dark pool / block trades | All quality sources paid ($300+/mo) |
| Bloomberg ESI | Enterprise pricing |
| 13F institutional positioning | 45-day filing lag limits short-term value (parking lot for future) |

**Tier 3 — Manual / external channels**
| Source | Status |
|--------|--------|
| External Telegram trading channels (e.g., JdubTrades) | Manual paste-and-analyze; video-only content not parseable. Future: build inbound webhook endpoint accepting structured payload (symbol, side, levels, source tag) |
| Discord / private Slack signal rooms | Same as above — manual interim, webhook future |

## 📍 Outstanding Items

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Official sigil SVG | Pending from designer | Placeholder `branding/sigil.svg` ships; replace file once received, rebuild icons |
| A1 real-data backtest | Pending (network access required) | Run `scripts/run_a1_backtest.py` when outbound network available; synthetic run confirmed harness works |
| Manual signal ingestion API | Backlog | No inbound API yet. Spec: `POST /api/proposals/manual` with `{symbol, side, entry, stop, target, rationale, source}` — flows through same approval UI. ~3hr Sonnet sprint when prioritized |
| Video signal channel parsing | Out of scope | External channels publishing video-only (e.g., JdubTrades) cannot be parsed; interim is screenshot OCR or manual transcription |
| iOS Phase 2 decision | Blocked on metrics | Measure PWA adoption (2 weeks from P3 ship), DAU >50% of installs = greenlight |
| Broker integration (Alpaca / IB) | Q3+ 2026 | Out of scope for May release |
